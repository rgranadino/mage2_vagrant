; You must uncomment one (and only one) line from the following to load
; the xdebug extension.
;zend_extension_ts="/usr/lib/php4/xdebug.so"
;zend_extension_ts="c:\php4\xdebug.dll"
;zend_extension="c:\php4\xdebug.dll"

; When this setting is set to on, the tracing of function calls will be enabled
; just before the script is run. This makes it possible to trace code in the
; auto_prepend_file.
xdebug.auto_trace=Off

; This setting, defaulting to On, controls whether Xdebug should write the
; filename used in include(), include_once(), require() or require_once() to
; the trace files.
xdebug.collect_includes=On

; This setting, defaulting to 0, controls whether Xdebug should collect the
; parameters passed to functions when a function call is recorded in either the
; function trace or the stack trace.
; The setting defaults to Off because for very large scripts it may use huge
; amounts of memory and therefore make it impossible for the huge script to run.
; You can most safely turn this setting on, but you can expect some problems in
; scripts with a lot of function calls and/or huge data structures as parameters.
; Xdebug 2 will not have this problem with increased memory usage, as it will
; never store this information in memory. Instead it will only be written to disk.
; This means that you need to have a look at the disk usage though.
; This setting can have four different values. For each of the values a different
; amount of information is shown. Below you will see what information each of the
; values provides. See also the introduction of the feature Stack Traces for a
; few screenshots.
; Value Argument Information Shown
; 0 None.
; 1 Type and number of elements (f.e. string(6), array(8)).
; 2 Type and number of elements, with a tool tip for the full information.
; 3 Full variable contents (with the limits respected as set by
; xdebug.var_display_max_children, xdebug.var_display_max_data and
; xdebug.var_display_max_depth.
; 4 Full variable contents and variable name.
xdebug.collect_params=0

; This setting, defaulting to Off, controls whether Xdebug should write the
; return value of function calls to the trace files.
xdebug.collect_return=On

; This setting tells Xdebug to gather information about which variables are
; used in a certain scope. This analysis can be quite slow as Xdebug has to
; reverse engineer PHP's opcode arrays. This setting will not record which
; values the different variables have, for that use xdebug.collect_params.
; This setting needs to be enabled only if you wish to use
; xdebug_get_declared_vars().
xdebug.collect_vars=Off

; If this setting is On then stacktraces will be shown by default on an error
; event. You can disable showing stacktraces from your code with xdebug_disable().
; As this is one of the basic functions of Xdebug, it is advisable to leave this
; setting set to 'On'.
xdebug.default_enable=On

; These seven settings control which data from the superglobals is shown when an
; error situation occurs. Each php.ini setting can consist of a comma seperated
; list of variables from this superglobal to dump, but make sure you do not add
; spaces in this setting. In order to dump the REMOTE_ADDR and the REQUEST_METHOD
; when an error occurs, add this setting: xdebug.dump.SERVER = REMOTE_ADDR,REQUEST_METHOD
xdebug.dump.COOKIE=
xdebug.dump.FILES=
xdebug.dump.GET=
xdebug.dump.POST=
xdebug.dump.REQUEST=
xdebug.dump.SERVER=
xdebug.dump.SESSION=

; Controls whether the values of the superglobals as defined by the xdebug.dump.*
; settings whould be shown or not.
xdebug.dump_globals=On

; Controls whether the values of the superglobals should be dumped on all error
; situations (set to Off) or only on the first (set to On).
xdebug.dump_once=On

; If you want to dump undefined values from the superglobals you should set this
; setting to On, otherwise leave it set to Off.
xdebug.dump_undefined=Off

; Controls whether Xdebug should enforce 'extended_info' mode for the PHP parser;
; this allows Xdebug to do file/line breakpoints with the remote debugger. When
; tracing or profiling scripts you generally want to turn off this option as PHP's
; generated oparrays will increase with about a third of the size slowing down
; your scripts. This setting can not be set in your scripts with ini_set(), but
; only in php.ini.
xdebug.extended_info=1

; Introduced in Xdebug 2.1
; This setting determines the format of the links that are made in the display
; of stack traces where file names are used. This allows IDEs to set up a
; link-protocol that makes it possible to go directly to a line and file by
; clicking on the filenames that Xdebug shows in stack traces. An example format
; might look like: myide://%f@%l
; The possible format specifiers are:
; %f the filename
; %l the line number
xdebug.file_link_format=

; Controls which IDE Key Xdebug should pass on to the DBGp debugger handler.
; The default is based on environment settings. First the environment setting
; DBGP_IDEKEY is consulted, then USER and as last USERNAME. The default is set
; to the first environment variable that is found. If none could be found the
; setting has as default ''.
xdebug.idekey=

; This is the base url for the links from the function traces and error message
; to the manual pages of the function from the message. It is advisable to set
; this setting to use the closest mirror.
xdebug.manual_url=http://www.php.net

; Controls the protection mechanism for infinite recursion protection. The value
; of this setting is the maximum level of nested functions that are allowed before
; the script will be aborted.
xdebug.max_nesting_level=250

; Introduced in Xdebug 2.1
; By default Xdebug overloads var_dump() with its own improved version for displaying
; variables when the html_errors php.ini setting is set to 1. In case you do not
; want that, you can set this setting to 0, but check first if it's not smarter
; to turn off html_errors.
xdebug.overload_var_dump=On

; When this setting is set to 1, profiler files will not be overwritten when a
; new request would map to the same file (depnding on the xdebug.profiler_output_name setting.
; Instead the file will be appended to with the new profile.
xdebug.profiler_append=0

; Enables Xdebug's profiler which creates files in the profile output directory.
; Those files can be read by KCacheGrind to visualize your data. This setting
; can not be set in your script with ini_set().
xdebug.profiler_enable=0

; When this setting is set to 1, you can trigger the generation of profiler
; files by using the XDEBUG_PROFILE GET/POST parameter. This will then write
; the profiler data to defined directory.
xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger=1

; The directory where the profiler output will be written to, make sure that the
; user who the PHP will be running as has write permissions to that directory.
; This setting can not be set in your script with ini_set().
xdebug.profiler_output_dir=/vagrant/data

; This setting determines the name of the file that is used to dump traces into.
; The setting specifies the format with format specifiers, very similar to sprintf()
; and strftime(). There are several format specifiers that can be used to format
; the file name.
; See the xdebug.trace_output_name documentation for the supported specifiers.
xdebug.profiler_output_name=cachegrind.out.%p

; Normally you need to use a specific HTTP GET/POST variable to start remote debugging.
; When this setting is set to 'On' Xdebug will always attempt to start a remote
; debugging session and try to connect to a client, even if the GET/POST/COOKIE
; variable was not present.
xdebug.remote_autostart=Off

; This switch controls whether Xdebug should try to contact a debug client which
; is listening on the host and port as set with the settings xdebug.remote_host
; and xdebug.remote_port. If a connection can not be established the script will
; just continue as if this setting was Off.
xdebug.remote_enable=On

; Can be either 'php3' which selects the old PHP 3 style debugger output, 'gdb'
; which enables the GDB like debugger interface or 'dbgp' - the brand new debugger
; protocol. The DBGp protocol is more widely supported by clients. See more
; information in the introduction for Remote Debugging.
xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp

; Selects the host where the debug client is running, you can either use a host
; name or an IP address.
xdebug.remote_host=192.168.56.1
xdebug.remote_connect_back = 1
; If set to a value, it is used as filename to a file to which all remote debugger
; communications are logged. The file is always opened in append-mode, and will
; therefore not be overwritten by default. There is no concurrency protection
; available.
xdebug.remote_log=

; Selects when a debug connection is initiated. This setting can have two different values:
; req Xdebug will try to connect to the debug client as soon as the script starts.
; hit Xdebug will only try to connect to the debug client as soon as an error condition occurs.
xdebug.remote_mode=req

; The port to which Xdebug tries to connect on the remote host. Port 9000 is the
; default for both the client and the bundled debugclient. As many clients use
; this port number, it is best to leave this setting unchanged.
xdebug.remote_port=9000

; When this setting is set to 1, Xdebug will show a stack trace whenever an
; exception is raised - even if this exception is actually caught.
xdebug.show_exception_trace=0

; When this setting is set to something != 0 Xdebug's generated stack dumps in
; error situations will also show all variables in the top-most scope. Beware
; that this might generate a lot of information, and is therefore turned off by default.
xdebug.show_local_vars=0

; When this setting is set to something != 0 Xdebug's human-readable generated
; trace files will show the difference in memory usage between function calls.
; If Xdebug is configured to generate computer-readable trace files then they
; will always show this information.
xdebug.show_mem_delta=0

; The format of the trace file.
; 0 shows a human readable indented trace file with: time index, memory usage,
; memory delta (if the setting xdebug.show_mem_delta is enabled), level,
; function name, function parameters (if the setting xdebug.collect_params
; is enabled, filename and line number.
; 1 writes a computer readable format which has two different records. There
; are different records for entering a stack frame, and leaving a stack frame
xdebug.trace_format=0

; When set to '1' the trace files will be appended to, instead of being overwritten
; in subsequent requests.
xdebug.trace_options=0

; The directory where the tracing files will be written to, make sure that the
; user who the PHP will be running as has write permissions to that directory.
xdebug.trace_output_dir=/tmp

; This setting determines the name of the file that is used to dump traces into.
; The setting specifies the format with format specifiers, very similar to
; sprintf() and strftime(). There are several format specifiers that can be used
; to format the file name. The '.xt' extension is always added automatically.
;The possible format specifiers are:
; %c crc32 of the current working directory trace.%c trace.1258863198.xt
; %p pid trace.%p trace.5174.xt
; %r random number trace.%r trace.072db0.xt
