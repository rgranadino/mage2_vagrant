## Magento2 Vagrant Box
A simple way to get magento2 up and running. It consists of a Debian Wheezy box provised via Puppet. The provider is Virtual Box. It will install apache2 +fastcgi, php, php-fpm, mysql and any other necessary dependancies.

The Magento 2 repository is a git submodule and can be edited/explored from the host machine. It is accessed by the guest via shared directories.

### Usage
#### Prerequisites
Install the following before proceeding through installation. This may require a restart after installing all software. 

* Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
* VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Git Bash (Windows users): https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Github account: https://github.com/

#### Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/rgranadino/mage2_vagrant.git`
2. Navigate into the repository via `cd mage2_vagrant`
2. **IMPORTANT**: If you cloned the repository without the *--recursive* param, you need to initialize the required submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Start up virtual machine: `vagrant up`
4. Point a host name to 192.168.56.10 in /etc/hosts `echo '192.168.56.10 mage2.dev' >> /etc/hosts`
>NOTE: Some composer dependancies require git. Agent Forwarding over SSH is enabled in the Vagrant file but you must have `ssh-agent` running and your key added. Running `ssh-add` should add the default key to the identities list, which presumably is the same key used to access github/bitbucket. You'll may also need to create a API access token in github, instructions can be found [here](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/trouble/git/tshoot_rate-limit.html): 
5. Once the machine completes provisioning, SSH to the server (`vagrant ssh`).
6. Add your Magento Connect authentication credentials to the global composer auth.json:

  * Open or create the file `~/.composer/auth.json`
  * Add the Magento Connect authentication credentials (if you have not already, follow this guide to [create your Magento Connect authentication keys](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html)):

    ```json
    {
        "http-basic": {
            "repo.magento.com": {
                "username": "<public key>",
                "password": "<private key>"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  
 * Or you can use the composer config command: `composer.phar global config http-basic.repo.magento.com <public_key> <private_key>`

7. Run composer
   ```bash
   cd /vagrant/data/magento2; # This is the document root
   composer install -v;
   ```
   * If you did not set your ~/.composer/auth.json file, you will be prompted for credentials to repo.magento.com. Hit ctrl+C to cancel and go back to step 6.
   * You will be prompted for a Github token. Follow the instructions given in the shell.

8. Install Magento 2 by running:

 * Via CLI (recommended)
   
   * If on Windows, you will need to run the following in order for the reinstall command to work. If you do not, you will see an error like `-bash: /home/vagrant/bin/reinstall: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory`
     ```
     sudo apt-get install dos2unix;
     dos2unix /home/vagrant/bin/reinstall;
     dos2unix /vagrant/data/magento2/bin/magento;
     ```
     * `reinstall` (Magento **without** sample data) or `reinstall -s` (Magento **with** sample data).

 * Via Web Installer

   * Please go to the Magento directory within the vagrant box (`cd /vagrant/data/magento2/`) and run `composer install`. Then open 'http://mage2.dev/setup' in your browser and go through the installation process.

Note: If you do not see sample data after running the above command, run the following:

```
cd /vagrant/data/magento2;
mkdir -p var/composer_home;
cp ~/.composer/auth.json var/composer_home;
bin/magento sampledata:deploy;
bin/magento setup:upgrade;
```

Note: If you have issues with images not displaying on the site, run the following:
```
cd /vagrant/data/magento2;
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```

#### Updating
1. From the host machine run `git pull && git submodule update --init && vagrant provision`.
  * If there is an update to the *manifests/mage.pp* or *files/** files it is recommended to provision the guest machine. This can be done by running: `vagrant provision`. There is also a cron that runs every 15 minutes to
provision within the guest machine in the event it's not done after updating.
2. If you want to start from a clean slate run: `reinstall` from within the guest machine. This will uninstall the application and reinstall it from scratch.


#### Shell Aliases / Scripts
* `m` - cd into the base magento directory: /vagrant/data/magento2
* `reinstall` - run magento shell uninstall script with the `cleanup_database` flag and run installation again, uses `http://mage2.dev` as base URL
 * `reinstall -s` - install magento with sample data
* `mt` - run bulk magento test suites

#### Status and Debug utilities
A status vhost on port 88 has been setup to view apache's server status, php-fpm status as well as some other utilities.

* http://mage2.dev:88/server-status
* http://mage2.dev:88/fpm-status
* http://mage2.dev:88/info.php
* http://mage2.dev:88/opcache.php
* http://mage2.dev:88/webgrind
